# For dictionary contributors
* Just open an issue in this project.

## To contribute new dictionary repositories
* We will just need to list your dictionary repository in <dictioanryIndices.md>. Open an issue in this project.
* Creating your dictionary repository:
  * Just follow the pattern you observe in, say [this repo](<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sanskrit-coders/stardict-sanskrit/master/sa-head/tars/tars.MD>).
  * Note that the filename of your dictionary should have two parts, separated by __, as in `kRdanta-rUpa-mAlA__2016-02-20_23-22-27`.
    * The first part should be the actual dictionary name, the second the timestamp.
  * All stardict and other dictionary files should have names matching the dictionary name specified above.
